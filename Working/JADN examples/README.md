# JADN IM Examples

JSON Abstract Data Notation ([JADN](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-jadn/tree/working))
is an information modeling language initially developed by the OASIS Open Command and Control
(OpenC2) TC to support development and
[documentation](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/oc2ls/v1.0/cs02/oc2ls-v1.0-cs02.html#33-content)
of the OpenC2 language. The same IM is used to both validate messages and generate
property tables used in the standard, ensuring consistency between the two.

JADN is not specific to OpenC2, and this folder contains examples of other document or
protocol specifications expressed JADN format. The examples are not necessarily complete,
current, or correct, and have not been endorsed by the spec developers. The intent is
to illustrate how JADN could specify common information building blocks applicable across
a range of applications.
