## **Q: How have bills of material and supply chain transparency been helpful elsewhere?**
**A:**
Bills of Materials and supply chain management principles have been transformative
to the automotive industry, the food industry, and general manufacturing for decades.
Many of these principles were pioneered by Toyota in the 1940s and have been
improved continuously across a growing list of industries. 
A key aspect of this revolution
is transparency of the supply chain and knowledge of source, quality, 
and how to address defects efficiently. 
A promise of this SBOM initiative is to apply proven supply
chain principles to modern software development. 
In fact, the defense and financial sectors have been
experimenting with software supply chain transparency 
for decades.
