## **Q: What is meant by a "claim" in defining an SBOM?**
**A:** 
The [OSIM definition of SBOM](./sbom.md) defines that an SBOM 
"can be modeled as a *CLAIM* made by some known [IDENTITY](./identity.md)
regarding the [COMPOSITION](./composition.md) of an [unambiguously identified piece of software](./naming.md)".
[The OSIM Supply Chain Information Model](tbd) defines *CLAIM* per 
[RFC 8392](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8392)
as "is a piece of information asserted about a subject".
In our case, the "piece of information" is the 
"COMPOSITION of an unambiguously identified piece of software",
and the claim is asserted by "some known IDENTITY".
