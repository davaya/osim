## **Q: How does OSIM define "supply chain"?**
**A:**
In the context of OSIM, a supply chain is the network of individuals, organizations, resources, activities, dependencies, and technologies involved in building, delivering, operating, maintaining, and evolving technology products and services throughout their lifecycle.

The supply chain may involve both physical and virtual [artifacts](./artifact.md). OSIM's immediate focus is software, although the [charter](../Charter.md)'s scope includes hardware products.
