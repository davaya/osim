## **Q: What is meant by the "exploitability" flavor of  SBOM?**
**A:** 
A exploitability [flavor](./flavors.md) of SBOM is any SBOM that contains exploitability information
about the primary component, or dependencies, in the SBOM.

The [NTIA "Vulnerability-Exploitability eXchange (VEX) – An Overview" document](https://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/vex_one-page_summary_0.pdf)
maintains there is value to this flavor 
to provide users (e.g., operators, developers, and services
providers) additional information on whether a product is impacted by a specific vulnerability in an
included component and, if affected, whether there are actions recommended to remediate. 
In many cases , a vulnerability in an upstream component will not be “exploitable” in the final
product for various reasons (e.g., the affected code is not loaded by the compiler, or some inline
protections exist elsewhere in the software).
To reduce effort spent by users investigating non-exploitable vulnerabilities that don’t affect a
software product, suppliers may include information about 
products that are 'not affected' by certain vulnerabilities as well.
