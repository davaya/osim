## **Q: What is meant by the "vulnerability" flavor of  SBOM?**
**A:** 
A vulnerability [flavor](./flavors.md) of SBOM is any SBOM that contains vulnerability information
about any of the components in the SBOM.
The [NTIA "Roles and Benefits for SBOM Across the Supply Chain" document](https://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ntia_sbom_use_cases_roles_benefits-nov2019_0.pdf)
maintains there is value to this flavor for software providers (avoid known vulnerabilities),
for those choosing software (easier due dilengence on security risk),
and to software operators (faster identification and resolution of security risk, know if and where specific software is affected).
