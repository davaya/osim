## **Q: What is meant by SBOM flavors?**
**A:** 
One of the dictionary definintions 
of the noun flavor is:
"a kind, variety, or sort".
And one of the definitions of the verb flavor is:
"add or enhance to give a distinctive quality to".

In keeping with the 'food ingredients' analogy for SBOMs, the term "SBOM flavor" is the specific set of SBOM attributes for a particular use between two parties.

For example one organization may require it's suppiers 
to provide the flavor of SBOM that includes licenses.

Another organization may require it's suppliers

but that it has to be a 'complete' component list
which is a different flavor than only requiring
the first-level components to be provided.

Yet another may require that vulnerability exploitability attributes must also be supplies
