## **Q: What is meant by the "license" flavor of  SBOM?**
**A:** 
A license [flavor](./flavors.md) of SBOM is any SBOM that contains licensing information.
The [NTIA "Roles and Benefits for SBOM Across the Supply Chain" document](https://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ntia_sbom_use_cases_roles_benefits-nov2019_0.pdf
maintains there is value to this flavor for software providers (quantify and manage licenses and associated risk),
for those choosing software (easier due dilengence on license risk),
and to software operators (more efficient, accurate responses to license claims).
