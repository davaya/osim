## **Q: What is meant by supplychain profiles?**
**A:** 
Supplychain profiles are specified in the 
[Supplychain Information Model](tbd)
as collections of optional model attributes to 
solve the need of particular use case.

For example, there are several profiles associated component inventory, several with vulnerability
management, several with license management, several with end-of-life/service/security, etc.

[Flavors](./flavors.md) can be considered in the problem space and exist
independent of any implementation, specification, or solution.
Profiles are a codification/specification in the solution space of the [Supplychain Information Model](tbd).
