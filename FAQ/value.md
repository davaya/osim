## **Q: What is the value of supply chain information modeling standards?**

**A:**
One might wonder about the value of supply chain information model standards to the various participants in technology supply chains: vendors, governments, enterprises, open source maintainers, service providers, and so on. A productive place to begin is to abstract the discussion from specific actors and instead examine roles which are variously shared, and not, across the ecosystem. 

NTIA ([2019](https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/ntia_sbom_use_cases_roles_benefits-nov2019.pdf)) has previously used the roles of Producer, Chooser, and Operator to analyze and examine the roles and benefits of Software Bills of Materials. We might extend this taxonomy to consider additional roles:

| Role | Description | Examples |
| :--: | ----------- | -------- |
| **Producer**     | Creates or assembles components (hardware, software, data) for use in the supply chain | Hardware manufacturers, software developers, cloud service providers |
| **Chooser**      | Selects components, products, or services produced by others | Enterprises procuring products, end-users shopping for devices, developers selecting OSS libraries |
| **Operator**     | Runs, manages, or maintains the supply chain components over their lifecycle | Cloud operators, DevOps teams, IT administrators |
| **Consumer**     | Uses components, products, or services produced by others | Retail consumers using devices, enterprise developers integrating APIs, developers building with OSS |
| **Regulator**    | Sets rules, policies, or standards that govern how a supply chain should operate safely | Governments, standards bodies (e.g., ISO, NIST), industry consortia |
| **Observer**     | Monitors the supply chain for performance, security, or compliance | Governments, security auditors, monitoring platforms, third-party certification authorities | 
| **Collaborator** | Works with other actors to co-develop, enhance, or maintain shared components | Open source contributors, joint ventures, or consortia participants |

In this frame, we can articulate the individualized benefits which information model standardization brings to each role:

* **Producer**: Streamlines integration into downstream workflows, reduces duplication, and broadens market reach
* **Chooser**: Provides readily comparable information for decision-making, enhancing trust and reducing risk in procurement
* **Operator**: Enables automation, simplifies maintenance, and ensures consistent processes across heterogeneous environments
* **Consumer**: Simplifies component selection, ensures compatibility, and reduces integration effort
* **Regulator**: Enables clear, enforceable frameworks that improve compliance and reduce ambiguities
* **Observer**: Improves visibility, simplifies monitoring, and enhances the ability to detect and respond to issues
* **Collaborator**: Aligns contributions, fosters interoperability, and accelerates co-development of shared tools or platforms
