## **Q: What is meant by a "some known IDENTITY" in defining an SBOM?**
**A:** 
The [OSIM definition of SBOM](./sbom.md) defines that an SBOM 
"can be modeled as a [CLAIM](./claim.md) made by some known *IDENTITY*
regarding the [COMPOSITION](./composition.md) of an [unambiguously identified piece of software](./naming.md)".
[The OSIM Supply Chain Information Model](tbd) 
defines the author of the SBOM as the "some known *IDENTITY*",
and it is that author that is making the claim regarding the composition of the software.
Note the author may be making the claim based on upstream claims by upstream authors.
Also note the author may be a person, an organization, a tool, or some combination of those.
