## **Q: Won’t SBOMs be a “roadmap to the attacker”?**
**A:**
Theoretically, yes. 
In reality, the defensive benefits of transparency far outweigh this
common concern as SBOMs serve more as a “roadmap for the defender”. 
All information is dual-edged, 
but insufficient software transparency affords attackers
asymmetrical advantages.
* First, attackers don’t need SBOMs; mass, indiscriminate attacks like WannaCry
serve to remind us that foreknowledge is not a prerequisite to cause harm.
* Second, attackers and their tools can more easily identify software components;
conversely, it is often quite challenging, disruptive, inefficient, and even unlawful
for defenders to determine the same.
* Third, attackers of any single product can already find human-readable target
components — licensing requirements have been increasingly requiring
disclosure for decades.

SBOMs seek to level the playing field for defenders 
by providing additional transparency — at enterprise scale — with standard, 
machine-readable decision support
