## **Q: Who uses an SBOM and for what?**
**A:** 
Most SBOM usage fits under one or more of three perspectives: those who produce
software, those who choose software, and those who operate software.
* For those who produce software, SBOMs are used to assist in the building and
maintenance of their software, including upstream components.
* For those who choose or purchase software, SBOMs are used to inform
pre-purchase assurance, negotiate discounts, or plan implementation strategies.
* For those who operate software, SBOMs are used to inform vulnerability
management and asset management, to manage licensing and compliance, and
to quickly identify software or component dependencies and supply chain risks
