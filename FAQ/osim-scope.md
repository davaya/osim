## **Q: What is the scope of OSIM's modeling activities?**
**A:**
The OASIS [OSIM](https://www.oasis-open.org/tc-osim/) page says:

> The OSIM TC aims to standardize and promote information models for supply chains,
> addressing the growing threat of cybersecurity breaches.
> The goal of the OSIM TC is to bring clarity to supply chain partners and eliminate
> the inefficiencies which come from the increase of disparate implementations.

An [Information Model](info-model) (IM) defines the essential content of documents and messages
used in computing, independently of how that content is represented for processing, communication
or storage. Abstract modeling has several benefits:
* An IM is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with uniform node structure, enabling straightforward
reuse of entity relationship (ER) diagram and other graph theory tooling
* Conceptual design can start with just named entities and relationships with no additional detail
* Entities defined by one community in one data format can be reused by other communities in other
formats, facilitated by structuring them as loosely-coupled building blocks

OSIM's goals of standardizing and promoting reusability of supply chain data requires documenting
the information modeling process and demonstrating it by building libraries of information components
from existing projects and standards, identifying opportunities for harmonization of similar
components, and promoting the process in collaboration with originating organizations.
