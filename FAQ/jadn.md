## **Q: What is JADN?**
**A:** 
JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) is
an information modeling language, based on information theory principles, 
that defines data structure independently of data format.
The model is documented using a compact and expressive interface definition language, property tables, 
or entity relationship diagrams, easing integration with existing design processes and architecture tools.

For more information see [Information Modeling with JADN](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-jadn-im/blob/working/imjadn-v1.0-cn02.md) and 
the [Specification for JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN)](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/jadn/v1.0/jadn-v1.0.html)

JADN is a syntax-independent schema language 
and is designed to work with common Internet data formats (e.g. JSON, XML, CBOR, Protobuf, SBE), 
providing a schema to support them. 
JADN is also graph-oriented to align with the web and database design practices, with options to identify primary and foreign keys, including web URLs.

JADN's native format is structured JSON. 
Therefore, a JADN schema is structured data that can easily be generated and transformed programmatically,
and a broad variety of tools exist for creating and manipulating information in JSON format.
