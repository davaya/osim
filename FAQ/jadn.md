## **Q: What is JADN?**
**A:** 
JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) is an [information modeling language](info-model.md) defined
by the OpenC2 [JADN](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/jadn/v2.0/jadn-v2.0.html) specification.
Unlike concrete schema languages such as XSD, JSON Schema and CDDL, it defines data structures
and constraints independently of data format and can be used directly to validate data values
in multiple formats. A JADN schema is a data value, allowing it to be formatted in the same way
as the data it defines, as well as schema-specific formats including a textual information
definition language, property tables in markdown or office document formats, and graphical formats
including entity relationship (ER) diagrams.

For more information on using JADN see the OASIS Committee Note
[Information Modeling with JADN](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-jadn-im/blob/working/imjadn-v1.0-cn02.md).
