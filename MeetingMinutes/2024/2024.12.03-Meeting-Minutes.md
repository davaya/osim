### Open Action Items from last meeting

* Action Item: (**Pending**) Jay to give Isaac and Duncan rights to start meeting recording
   - Trying new method. Jay to investigate individually inviting Isaac and Duncan to Teams meeting and assigning them roles
* Action Item: (**Done**) Isaac to draft PR to FAQ on 'claims/assertions' including 'multiple-file/transitive-assertions' 
* Action Item: (**Pending**) Duncan (or anyone else, particularly if they know how) to determine process to submit PWI to ISO
* Action Item: (**OBE**) All to consider whether to contribute individual comments to NIST on their Supply Chain Traceability document. Comments due 15-Nov. Note this is a request for individuals to consider commenting if they have views on topic. It is not for OSIM TC to comment.
* Action Item: (**Pending**) Patrick Maroney took an Action Item to investigate Entity Representation (ie the "naming" problem - how do we denote organizations, people, components, ...). See earlier in these notes. This is an important topic that all are welcome to contribute to.

### Standing Action Items for every meeting

* Action Item: (**STANDING**) Everyone to consider FAQs - especially about relationships with other work going on
* Action Item: (**STANDING**) Everyone to reread TC Charter
   * https://groups.oasis-open.org/higherlogic/ws/groups/0e391e7b-bc88-4983-8020-018f11106d27/documents/charter3676/document?document_id=71883
* Action Item: (**STANDING**) Everyone to think about problem space and where to focus

## V. Consent Agenda Items
The following items were circulated prior to meeting. 
* 

## VI. Discussion Items
Discussion to be cut off at 7 minutes to the hour to finish rest of agenda

* [PR #67](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/osim/pull/67) define supply chain
* The 'multiple-file/transitive-assertions' aspects of the "claims" action item were not addressed and presumably will be a separate PR by Isaac.
* Entity Representation per last meeting notes
* SBOM vs SBOM+ Issues wrt defintions
   - discussion started last several meetings and related topics earlier in this meeting.
   - Issues [#28](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/osim/issues/28), [#29](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/osim/issues/29), [#30](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/osim/issues/30), and [#31](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/osim/issues/31)
   - It is presumed these will be OBE once Isaac's PR is agreed to.
   - Issue 30 was discussed in particular and consensus to close for now and reopen if necessary should it become a relevant issue. 
* begin FAQ discussion by issue number
   - ran out of time. Discussion to be continued via eamil, GitHub issues, and at future meetings.
