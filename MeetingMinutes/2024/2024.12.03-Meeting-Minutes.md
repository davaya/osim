### Open Action Items from last meeting

* Action Item: (**Pending**) Jay to give Isaac and Duncan rights to start meeting recording
   - Trying new method. Jay to investigate individually inviting Isaac and Duncan to Teams meeting and assigning them roles. Still pending and new action item added wrt where are the recordings?
* Action Item: (**Done**) Isaac to draft PR to FAQ on 'claims/assertions' including 'multiple-file/transitive-assertions' 
* Action Item: (**Pending**) Duncan (or anyone else, particularly if they know how) to determine process to submit PWI to ISO. Discussed. OASIS has process for PAS (publicly approved standards) but apparently no process to put in a placeholder PWI until PAS is available. More research needed. Any help from ISO experts appreciated.
* Action Item: (**OBE**) All to consider whether to contribute individual comments to NIST on their Supply Chain Traceability document. Comments due 15-Nov. Note this is a request for individuals to consider commenting if they have views on topic. It is not for OSIM TC to comment.
* Action Item: (**Pending**) Patrick Maroney took an Action Item to investigate Entity Representation (ie the "naming" problem - how do we denote organizations, people, components, ...). Some work occurred via correspondence and discussion at meeting. This is an important topic that all are welcome to contribute to. Patrick still has action item to create PR.
