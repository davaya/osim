# Use Cases
For our project the term "use cases" is used loosely and means any
"cases" (eg scenarios) where the work products of this TC would be "used".

There are two subdirectories, aimed at two different audiences.

Value Scenarios describe the value proposition of the work of the TC.
The intended audience of Value Scenarios is outside the TC,
particularly showing the business value to the enterprise 
of making use of
our work products.
They tend to be high level.

Practioner Playbooks are playbooks, sequence diagrams, and the use cases practioners tend to operate at.
They get into the details.

In each of these directories, there are many subdirectories, 
one per TC member organization. 
Other work has shown that better consensus is reached if everybody
can present their own problem statments and solutions in a 
judgement-free environment.
Consensus can then be reached
