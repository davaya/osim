# NSAANSA
The Never Say Anything And No Such Agency (NSAANSA) is a ficticious agency, in the ficticious Department of Unnecessary Factoids, in a government.
It was first used in
[Cybersecurity Automation Village](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/casp/blob/main/Plugfests/2024-03-NorthernVirginia/Results/Presentations/UseCases.pdf).
Any resemblance to actual persons/companies/organizations/tools/products
is coincidental and unintended.

The NSAANSA has automated cybersecurity adhering to government policies including "comply to connect".
