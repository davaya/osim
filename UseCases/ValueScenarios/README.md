# Value Scenarios
Value Scenarios describe the value proposition of the work of the TC.
The intended audience of Value Scenarios is outside the TC,
particularly showing the business value to the enterprise 
of making use of
our work products.
They tend to be high level.

For the details of how to acheive the value, 
see [Practioner Playbooks](../PractionerPlaybooks/README.md).
